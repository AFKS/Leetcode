# 004 Median of Two Sorted Arrays

-  **Divide and conquer**
-  **Binary Search**


## Description
>There are two sorted arrays **nums1** and **nums2** of size m and n respectively.
>
>Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
>Example: 
>
>```
>nums1 = [1, 3]
>nums2 = [2]
>
>The median is 2.0
>```
>Example
>```
>nums1 = [1, 2]
>nums2 = [3, 4]
>
>The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
>```


## 1. Thought Line
###(1) The basic idea is to always compare the median of A and B and drop half of A or B elements based on the comparison results.

###(2) About median
- When the length is odd, median is num[length/2+1]
- When the length is even, median is (num[length/2+1]+num[length/2])/2
