# 202 Happy Number

## Description
> Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".
>A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

```text
Example: 19 is a happy number

12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```

### Hash Table

```c
class Solution {
public:
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        if(n<=0) return false;
        set<int> hash;
        while(n>1){
            if(hash.find(n)!=hash.end()) return false;
            hash.insert(n);
            int sum=0;
            while(n>0){
                sum+=pow(n%10,2);
                n /=10;
            }
            n = sum;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
