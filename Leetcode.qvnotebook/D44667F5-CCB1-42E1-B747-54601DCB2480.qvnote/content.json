Thought Line\n###(1) The basic idea is to always compare the median of A and B and drop half of A or B elements based on the comparison results.\n\n###(2) About median\n- When the length is odd, median is num[length/2+1]\n- When the length is even, median is (num[length/2+1]+num[length/2])/2\n\n\n\n\n## 2.  Divide-and-Conquer"
